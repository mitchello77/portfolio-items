                    <h3>The Origin</h3>

                    <p>Keith Money, a biographer of Anna Pavlova, wrote that a hotel chef in Wellington, New Zealand, created the dish when Pavlova visited there in 1926 on her world tour.</p>

                    <p>Professor Helen Leach, a culinary anthropologist at the University of Otago in New Zealand, has compiled a library of cookbooks containing 667 Pavlova recipes from more than 300 sources. Her book, <a href="https://books.google.com.au/books?id=jpI9KAAACAAJ&amp;dq=isbn:9781877372575&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2UEZVf6nEJDj8AX7v4CAAw&amp;redir_esc=y" target="_blank">The Pavlova Story: A Slice of New Zealand’s Culinary History</a>, states that the first Australian Pavlova recipe was created in 1935 while an earlier version was penned in 1929 in the rural magazine.</p>
                    <p>It has been claimed that Bert Sachse created the dish at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esplanade_Hotel,_Perth" target="_blank">Esplanade Hotel in Perth</a>, Australia in 1935. In defence of his claim as inventor of the dish, a relative of Sachse's wrote to Leach suggesting that Sachse may have accidentally dated the recipe incorrectly. Leach replied they would not find evidence for that "because it's just not showing up in the cookbooks until really the 1940s in Australia." (However, a 1937 <a href="http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/52262837" target="_blank">issue of the Australian Women's Weekly</a> contains a pavlova sweet cake recipe.) Of such arguments, Matthew Evans, a restaurant critic for The Sydney Morning Herald, said that it was unlikely that a definitive answer about the Pavlova’s origins would ever be found.</p>

                    <h3>Esplanade Hotel, Perth</h3>
                    <span class="source">Source: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esplanade_Hotel,_Perth" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esplanade_Hotel,_Perth</a>, used under a Creative Commons, Attribution - ShareAlike License.</span>
                    <p>The Esplanade Hotel was a hotel on the northern side of the Esplanade Reserve in Perth. Its demolition in 1972 was extremely controversial because of the building's beauty and popularity. Its early history appears in James Sykes Battye's Cyclopedia of 1912. Various proprietors owned the property over time, including N. W. Harper who sold it in 1927 to J. Paxton, whose daughter Elsie May Plowman became sole licensee in 1957. It was located opposite the Perth Bowling Club on the Esplanade Reserve. The hotel was one of nine in the Perth area to have orders to remove its verandahs in 1962 but its owner Elsie May Plowman responded with a successful court action against the Perth City Council regulation.</p>
