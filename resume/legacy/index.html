          <h2><span>Summary</span></h2>
          <p>Currently a student completing a double degree at QUT, approaching two years’ experience in commercial software development seeking to bring a fresh perspective into a company’s work culture whilst gaining valuable experience during further education.

          <h2><span>What I Am Looking For</span></h2>
          <p>There are two core expectations I hope to have fulfilled whilst being employed. Firstly, a working environment where my technical and design skills can be appreciated, engaged and grown. Secondly, a company that can support my studying commitments by being flexible and understanding of its unpredictable or demanding nature.</p>

              <p>Employed as a software engineer, to lead development in a new sales and stock analysis program utilizing my existing skills of WinForms and DevExpress. Working closely with the vision of the company director and my own innovation, the program introduced analysis and reporting capabilities to the existing software platform. This platform specifically focused on point of sales, stock management and invoicing. </p>

              <p>Task Specific Software Solutions (TS3)</p>
              <p>I was recruited, as a software engineer, to partake in a ‘Rookie Development Program’ designed to provide work experience, introduce students to the demands of a commercial environment and provide a source of income whilst supporting my studies at university. As a member of a small team, I developed operations and reporting software for both internal and client projects. I worked directly on projects for large Australian Manufacturing and Aviation clients. From this, I gained programming and interfacing knowledge within a Microsoft development environment. Additionally, my position matured my ability to manage time effectively, work on team based projects, delegate workflow and problem solve. I was often required to search through online forums or documentation for solutions to discrete client-specific development issues. The program was finalised at the end of 2015.</p>
